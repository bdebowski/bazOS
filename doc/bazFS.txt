The bazFS File System - A simplified FAT16

- Sectors = Clusters = Blocks
- Block size is 512 Bytes
- FAT table entries are 16 bits
- Only one FAT table
- First data block contains Directory Entries for root dir "/"

Block 0: Boot Block
2B 	- Block Size
4B 	- Num Blocks on this logical partition
2B 	- Num Blocks per FAT table (N_fat)
8B 	- Name for this partition
16B	- Unused
380B	- Boot code

Block 1 to N_fat: FAT table blocks
- Each 2B entry is either:
    0x0000 = Block is free
    0xFFFF = Block is not available
    0xFFFE = Last block of respective block chain
    0x0001 - 0xFFFD = index of next block in chain

Block N_fat + 1 to ...: Data blocks
- Each data block contains either:
  - Directory Entries (DEs) or
  - File data
- DEs are 32 Bytes each (16 DEs per block)

Directory Entry:
11B 	- Name*
3B	- Extension
2B	- Index of first entry in FAT Table
4B	- Size in Bytes
12B	- Reserved/Unused

*First Byte in Name indicates if DE is free:
0xF0 = Free
0x00 = Free + all following DEs in this directory are free


Note:
- First data block contains DEs for root dir "/"
- Every dir contains a DE for directory:
  - "." the current dir
  - ".." the parent dir (except root dir which has no parent)
