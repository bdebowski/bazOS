The bazDS Drive System Specification

Drive is subdivided into N equal size blocks.
Block 0 contains the block size, drive size (in blocks), and the Partition Table.

Block 0:
Byte	Meaning
0-3 	- Z = Size of each block in Bytes
4-7	- N = Size of drive in blocks (including block 0)
8-(Z-1)	- Partition Table
	  - Each entry is 4 Bytes long and indicates the number of blocks assigned to that partition

Notes:
- Partition 0 must be the boot/primary partition
- Partitions are packed one after another.  Therefore a partition size of 0 indicates that all following partitions are also 0 in size.
- Partition size of 0 indicates no partition exists.
