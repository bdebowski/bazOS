The bazDS Drive System Specification

Drive is subdivided into 512B size blocks.
Block 0 contains the drive size and the Partition Table.

Byte	Meaning
0-3 	- Size of drive in Bytes
4-511 	- Size of partitions 0 - 126 in Bytes (each entry is 4B long)
512-N 	- bazFS partitions

Notes:
- Partition 0 must be the boot/primary partition
- Partitions are packed one after another.  Therefore a partition size of 0 indicates that all following partitions are also 0 in size.
- Partition size of 0 indicates no partition.
